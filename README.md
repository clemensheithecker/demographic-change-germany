# Demographic Change in Germanyâ€”A Case Study

A low birth rate and rising life expectancy are fueling demographic change in Germany. These trends pose economic challenges such as a dwindling labor force and the underfunding of social security systems. As a result, lawmakers must re-evaluate existing public policies and design new solutions. This case study provides data visualizations supporting the exploration and evaluation of policy options to solve these demographic problems.
